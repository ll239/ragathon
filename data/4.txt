16 Biggest Company Layoffs of all Time

by Patrick








üö® 2023 update: If your company is going through or considering layoffs as a way to cut costs we suggest exploring how employee ideas can save your company money. In this case study (link) you can see how just a handful of ideas saved one factory $360,000.  
If you look at the numbers, every ten to twenty years (we‚Äôll split the difference and call it fifteen), a major corporation decides to ‚Äúrestructure‚Äù its operation which, in laymen‚Äôs terms, means terminating the services of a ginormous number of workers. Rumors abound lately that IBM is set to fire over 100,000 employees (that‚Äôs dismiss, discharge, lay off, let go, give notice to, get rid of, ax, or sack depending on where you are at the moment) in what could turn out to be the largest layoff in history. While IBM may be the first to tread into the six-figure domain, the business world is certainly no stranger to mass layoffs in the five-figure range. Let‚Äôs take a look at the top sixteen mass layoffs. ¬†16) Microsoft ‚Äì 18,000 


In July of last year (that‚Äôs 2014 for you number challenged), Microsoft announced that it  
will lay off up to 18,000 employees.  The bulk of those employees (12,500 to be exact)  
will be cut from Microsoft‚Äôs mobile phone unit Nokia Devices and Services.  To paraphrase  
a familiar adage, let‚Äôs hope that when a Window closes for these employees, somewhere, a  
door opens.

15) Hon Hai ‚Äì 20,000 


While the western world boasts the bulk of the largest layoffs, the east should not be  
forgotten.  With over 400,000 employees worldwide, Hon Hai (a.k.a. Foxconn) 
was amongst the largest of the large in 2008.  Then the global recession hit and the behemoth slashed  5% of its workforce in order to control costs.

14) Hewlett-Packard ‚Äì 24,600 


Expansion in one area often means contraction in another.  That was certainly the case  
back in 2008 when HP set about diversifying its operation.  Once the dust settled, then  
CEO Mark Hurd trimmed the fat and 24,600 people found themselves without a job. Based on  
stock price alone (see above), it seems to have worked. 

13) Daimler Chrysler ‚Äì 26,000 


During the recession of 2001 (there was a recession back then too?!), Chrysler went  
through a major restructuring to resulted in 26,000 new first-time unemployment claims.   
The company barely recovered when the Great Recession of 2008 hit (that one I remember)  
and Chrysler ‚Äì being too big to fail ‚Äì was bailed out of Chapter 11.

12) Hewlett-Packard (Again!) ‚Äì 27,000 
 
We can only speculate what‚Äôs going on over at HP but with another massive layoff coming  
(this time the CEO was Meg Whitman) just four short years after 2008‚Äôs five-digit fiasco,  
it would be easy to conclude that something ain‚Äôt right. 

11) Bank of America ‚Äì 27,000 
 
Yep, just like Hewlett-Packard, Bank of America cut 27,000 jobs between 2012 and 2014  
after changing CEOs three or four times in as many years.  Hmm‚Ä¶maybe it‚Äôs not the jobs;  
maybe it‚Äôs the CEOs.

10) Bank of America ‚Äì 30,000 



The financial world is such a minefield, I don‚Äôt know how the major institutions do it.   
I guess it‚Äôs a good thing they do.  Sure there‚Äôs a chance that millions, if not billions,  
can be made, but there‚Äôs more of a chance that you‚Äôll fail miserably and take the global  
economy with you.  
Just after the turn of the millennium, banking giant Bank of America, which had just come  
through extensive mergers and acquisitions activity, eliminated 30,000 jobs it said were  
now redundant.  Welcome to the 21st century!

9) United States Postal Service ‚Äì 30,000 (a number of times) 
 
If you wanted to combine all the numbers, the United States Postal Service layoffs would  
top this list.  The first decade of the 21st century saw the USPS slash 30,000 jobs three  
times for a total of 90,000 postal workers sans employment.  I wonder if they cut more  
jobs than they moved packages and envelopes?

8) Boeing ‚Äì 31,000 


Who wanted to fly after September 11, 2001?  I didn‚Äôt.  If Boeing‚Äôs behavior was any  
indication, millions of others shared my view.  In response to the economic chaos that  
ensued, Boeing cut 31,000 jobs from its commercial aircraft division. No wonder Ebay has plenty of Boeing employee pins for sale!

7) Ford ‚Äì 35,000 


The first few years of this century were a difficult time for many of the United States‚Äô  
largest companies.  Perennial powerhouse Ford was no exception.  U.S. and world  
populations were holding everything close to the vest and this had a major impact on car  
sales.  Ford laid off 35,000 as a result of this contraction.

6) AT&T ‚Äì 40,000 



Back in the day (the late 1990s), AT&T was THE phone company.  Then things began to  
change.  Cellular phones began their rise and AT&T had to react.  40,000 workers were  
given pink slips and the company lumbered on.

5) General Motors ‚Äì 47,000 
 
2008 just sucked!  Everything went south and many mainstays in the business world were  
forced to make do. General Motors slashed 47,000 jobs in response to the sluggish sales  
that came as part of the fallout from the sub-prime mortgage disaster.  Things have since  
recovered for the largest auto makers but the early 2000s was just a bad time to be a  
member of the workforce.

4) Citigroup ‚Äì 50,000 



Another 2008 casualty was the financial firm Citigroup.  $20 billion in taxpayer money  
(TARP) wasn‚Äôt enough to stop the bleeding and Citigroup chose to fire 50,000 workers in  
an attempt to gain some control.

3) Sears/K-Mart ‚Äì 50,000 


Though these massive layoffs seem to congregate in the tech, automotive, and financial  
sector, retail is by no means immune.  In 1993, Sears and K-Mart were in the process of  
merging and the resultant blowback caused the elimination of 50,000 jobs.

2) IBM ‚Äì 60,000 


The early 1990s saw the rise of the internet and computer manufacturer IBM was struggling  
to find its place in the new paradigm.  Executives concluded that the company needed to  
cut costs and the most efficient way to do that was by eliminating 60,000 jobs.

1) U.S. Army ‚Äì 70,000 
 
Early in 2014, the Pentagon announced that it would begin the process of shrinking the  
armed forces to pre-World War Two levels.  This would mean reducing the number of troops  
to at least 450,000 and eliminating 70,000 active positions.

Conclusion ‚Äì record breaker on the way? 
So, as you can see, if IBM does indeed cut 110,000 jobs this year, it will crush the old  
record and slide easily into the top spot.  What conclusion can we draw from all of this?  
 Perhaps these mega companies ought to try keeping it ‚Äúsmall‚Äù (as small as you can be  
when you employ hundreds of thousands of people).  
Or maybe this is just the cycle of growth that we (the menial workers of the world)  
should come to expect from the business sector.  Whatever it may be, as the world‚Äôs  
population continues to increase and more and more people are employed, these mass  
layoffs will continue to increase in size as well.  Wake me when someone lays off  
250,000.
