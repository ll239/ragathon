and it's singer
and he's

hello and welcome to wet affleck have
you been to help d_-one s_ t_ to help
we're gonna have to decide knows more
about anchor level on that
granger is eleven that until i got to
get what happened there and you and
helping is held on top of that the
helpless without okay
so the helped is about eight nineteen
sixties young
writer skeeter played by emma stone who
has the revolutionary idea
african-americans should be treated like
human beings the haircut afsl no
uh... in the book and movie as she
starts listening to this story stay
there
their housekeepers they take care of
their families their land of their lives
and out she writes a book
and chaos in whole area the incident
still do
you steve
that one
t_v_ campaign finance
on marketing needs
starts
today
ste
systems
decided that that i had not
read the book review that data but kinda
sunday so how is the compared to the
book it was very faithful uh... and even
though the movie runs a little bit long
in my opinion active in games dating
these businesses that i had a pretty
long day condensed the correct things
uh...
um and that listings briefed by i
thought this movie was awesome to words
octavia spencer sounds amazing asi isn't
however innocent but there's all this
bomb ability there two or two
no and she keeps changing and uh...
collectible cast manilow nearly half the
acting is great and i cannot believe
with the idea by eliminating the oscar
nail actually has just emailing actress
and i have that much of the best get a
contest and that's yes mid-flight digby
whyy
negative highway cash basis so sweet and
so areas and it's a different from tree
of life years almost unrecognizable gap
just i thought she's a chameleon i lover
i can't wait to see you next time yet
and it's time to see an astounding sling
media more serious and she's so adorable
and took a great romantic comedy carol
and i think more to her than this
uh... they really typical spot here in
trying to take this air and the horrors
of despair and yet made a film it is
crowd-pleasing and i think people and i
think you have polytheistic alligator
effective today eight will seem really
safe and calculated and watered down and
not authentic and yet you can add to the
city burning you cannot do you have to
straddle that line wrapping up really
hard and baby appeared on the possibly
could have like to see a tv stands with
the flame for our dot thus i think that
fits a pattern talked with science
fiction florida for one thing the civil
rights movement did not need some skinny
white lady to help them tell their story
and get their word out to the world
african-americans ran the civil rights
movement white people help a little bit
sometimes
because this is another one of those
movies like new bureau cry freedom or
whatever schindler's list where
you have to tell the story the oppressed
minority throw the convenient
non-minority hero for the audience a
religious lesson in what i'm doing it
and add one thing that second of all
get all the time is it is mississippi
these names would not be spilled on
their stories to anybody who is going to
publish them and if they did they would
know
that those nice ladies in there was no
stories about their husbands who were
secretly the ku klux klan would come
burn their house pat
and half and area like cartoon only
ninety five and a lot of great but it's
are never bought it and never bought it
it's just it isn't so not true the era
you have to make such a unique
to buy into this story has just rolled
antibody to the aftermath of this whole
debate i just it just by could never get
on that but it was just too ridiculous
thing that i don't think you are wrong
but i don't think you're right
now nothing like that
because
the the movie is like it's a microcosm
it's a small it's like the small town in
mississippi and it's everyone knows each
other
and set of that who's to say that
something like that couldn't have
happened
where there was one white person in the
small group of some white people that
help civil rights along
lake and then there may well have been
that senate completely willing and
completely willing to allow the movie
that because it it just because i happen
to me emotionally so much that was on
this roller coaster with them for
two-and-a-half hours and didn't care and
in a world where i'm a busy girl like i
i don't wanna spent two-and-a-half hours
in a movie unless it's awesome in this
movie was
awesome
but i just didn't i didn't buy it i
didn't enjoy my job i like the
performances i thought your bio it is
greater dispensers great
brussels howard is pushing it a little
is catching anything on the edge but
it's pretty good i was just basic is
dynamite
but does this really tight i just think
also i discussed interaction design it
feels very weighty at that particular
time why three file no no they have it
did look they capture the air well as
far as the visuals of growth but just
didn't buy it
this movie is completely phony version
of early sixties mississippi one about
the book anyway
light line and i'm going to have this is
an article by michael and i think that
we are into this a while for movies
about the horrors of nazi germany
to get something
you know i mean clearing the way
downplay the hearts of nazi germany but
to make movies that were smart
an intricate and not like super obvious
insure it all and you know i goal you
know
and i think we're not too far enough
away from jim crow segregation self to
do a movie that is new ones
uh... yet apparently at least as
evidenced by the help of his movie has
all the nuance of white
sixteenth on with the falls on bugs
bunny many damn great moments and fell
to between i'm astounded and biology
between violent and it's not t_v_
spencer they are in there now the
message is not final no doubt
are moments when and where there are a
character actions that are believable
all interests we did that are
yelled at work but they are all in the
context of an in his service on a
completely unbelievable story
it's i think that the movie it
definitely can be accused of leaning
towards melodrama and they can't get it
i mean and so that's why i say i think i
want my response to what you're saying
is a gray area
maciel anything in the entire nobody
voted but
i think that the still these are hardly
percent performance and you go
to see these women just acting their
hearts out binges really connecting with
each other and with the body incident
with me at least or in bogota below that
is a need to to see these performances
you're going to have to endure the movie
database and especially for at aaron and
elijah signing i thought it he'd packet
peter at directors guild livestock it
got me that they were irritating the
lawyer growing so hard against all but i
was not having it said it is that there
are seven endings to this move that's
sure
okay kids why do you think it's over two
hundred dollars a vote of no there's
more elegant
it's going to put your coat of recovery
regarded as one of those kind of movie
there's a little lord of the rings email
and i tried every time you think it's
done there's another ninety three
bottles of beer on the wall of
cincinnati at the numbers
this grant
icy eight
love these ladies friend reform half
have also given eight which give this
six point eight it's around a seventy
four thirty five percent right now on
the tornado meter
applicable acme in that it is a book
sounds like it is
gathering talent miss grace perspective
m_i_t_i_ faster but that's about
thank or don't thrombus fine-tuning
