and only per clear him damn lens flares on the  
camera this is really starting a heavy note let's 
just completely ignore the big white dude in her

was bringing her a jar of honey who the are

residue but the prince on the gun were your  
mothers yep I wanted to thank you for taking 
care of my mom tried to stay in her life as  
much as I could obviously I could have done a 
better job being old can be a lonely thing the

of life or the family or of the hive I guess you  
could say you know I think I know why she liked 
you you're just like my brother he was in marso

moment back to business as usual so in 
this beekeeper program you retire and

today I do good cuz uh today's your lucky day cuz 
apparently your mother's house is on fire too and  
some other [ __ ] This Woman's dealing with a 
lot of what a coldhearted way of delivering that  
information United dat grou well he's handsome 
you think there's even the remotest chance that  
the dude who burned down United data group is 
the same guy we entering the spot from your  
mother The Beekeeper said the name of the title 
this movie is taking itself just serious enough  
you know what I mean yeah to like it's actually 
a really fascinating tone they're writing and it  
because you you want the action to feel like 
th Artic when it's happening instead of just  
hurry up and get to it it's fun who who the is 
he tell me who he is right now I I I I don't know
beekeeper what's he saying about 
bees I don't know he said he was  
protecting the hive or something 
he in the back of the car there he
is oh he wanted him to make that call I I got 
NF what no is this man what is he doing is he  
going to drag him with the car or you're 
[ __ ] crazy man what the [ __ ] bro oh is  
he going to drag him uh I feel like it worse 
than that man that's pretty bad drag is still  
bad oh I think he's going to drive it off and 
he's going to go I don't know let's just find
out yeah cuz isn't the Bridge open yeah oh 
God cool well technically a drag do I have  
the pleasure of speaking with yes you burned 
up a million dollar call center now I'm going  
to burn you down you haven't told me your name 
you Mr you and you bettering remember it [Music]
you sound young I bet you don't 
have estate planning I'm I'm 28  
years old why would I need that I'm about to show
you 80s action dialogue and this is your data 
mining consumer service business right yeah  
something like that pulling in 9 million 
a month one office I've got like 20 if a  
beekeeper says you're going to die you're going 
to die there's nothing I can do or or anybody  
else to stop it oh cuzz he's a CIA he knows 
who he is yeah I could have done anything but  
I chose this job as a favor to your mother I 
keep danth Enterprises safe is his stepfather  
Wallace just tell me what the this guy is he's 
probably the last pair of eyes that you're  
going to sneer at that is daunting it's like 
Jeremy Irons wants his stepson to die what'd  
you get on Clay he's a ghost all I have is a 
birth certificate as social never even had a  
bank account why does this guy seem so goddamn 
apathetic towards everything Adam clay doesn't  
exist which is terrifying to me because he's 
probably in a classified program if we don't  
get a beekeeper Cinematic Universe I will Riot 
wasted opportunity I'll give you a board seat  
on the holding company that's another million 
a year plus you promised you'd take care of  
him you have my word oh he really loves 
her my young friend seems to have caught  
the unwanted attentions of of a beekeeper 
a beekeeper beekeeper well that's not good
[Music] dark yellow yellow is the theme color 
in this film he's retired from the program no  
longer active well that Chang I like the reversal 
on this framing now he's handheld and she's Center  
framed in the camera still the current active 
beekeeper lunatic should have been removed months
ago almost feels like the Continental 
little with like uh with tech that's  
upgrade but like lower crate I hear 
like fax machines and old monitors and
stuff got my job honey
uh-oh get out of here oh yes yes you 
need colorful personality bag guys let's
go oh uh what are you going to do
oh you've been a busy bee kill 
her I'm assuming you're my
replacement
ouch
God the action so
good ouch Jesus he really is Batman 
oh wow wow damn this this turned  
into a whole kind of different 
action movies oh Jesus L her up
what a burn he still has not fired one shot in 
this film really that is impressive good catch
Andrew okay so he takes the fingers and I have 
no idea why did you it's like dude you're sure  
no problem badass work I'm a fan me that 
can set the whole G yeah man did he tell  
that guy that's civilian to leave to I hope 
so he doesn't seem like an evil human being  
that's a vehicle registered to a anet landroid 
everywhere he goes it ends up in Flames that's  
a minigun they use those on military vehicles 
do you know that puppy shoot 6,000 rounds a  
minute I do think all this like FBI [ __ ] could 
use a lot more personality though you know it's  
one part of the storytelling that I feel like 
lacks okay then do you know who Anna at landas  
is yes I do I think it's more him even so who 
doesn't exist in any commercial or government  
database someone who a ghost like our good 
friend Adam clay beekeeping for beekeepers  
I think she does a really good job though yeah I 
like her she's really good how are you my friend
good come on leave him alone leave him alone 
don't play with those things they go off oh my  
god look this is where all the diversity is 
and the stuntmen they got to play key roles  
for the action now Simon Says beekeepers 
have given all resources empowered to act  
on their own judgment for decades they have 
quietly worked to keep the hive safe damn  
I am the law beekeepers keep working until 
they die he's basically one of us he's not  
like you got to pull the stinger out with 
enough of you then maybe you just might in  
fact be able to kill him I like how they've 
constructed everything around being actual
beekeeping oh okay smart I thought beekeepers  
weren't supposed to intervene and 
why does that beekeeper behave so
sadistically he's getting the location of 
every single one he's going to take them  
all down we believe that Mr Clay is connected 
to a classified program named beekeeper let's  
stick to what we know [ __ ] she totally seems 
like she knows this is his next Target nin star  
United which appears to be the entity operating 
the regional call centers like the one that Mr  
Clay burned down why is Adam Clay on this Rampage 
tell him avenging my mother what's your ask my ask  
a swap team for starters surveillance support 
additional agents analysts that shouldn't be  
a problem do she want to stop him didn't I mean 
she wants to uncover the truth yeah she doesn't  
know exactly like what any connections are and 
stuff Phoenix where we at oh my God 201k 200k I  
love you how can you live with yourself doing 
this crap every Target on there was an older  
person out awful all weapons on Entry We Ready

there was a back entrance I would have used it I 
don't want to injure anyone who's innocent or not

Innocent for either one of us to close that  
distance some of them will get hurt let's 
start with this right here ouch [Music]
ouch wonder if they're going to go 
all film without him shooting a gun  
so does Jason S and view these guys as 
innocent they seem like they're working  
for the wrong people yeah but this would be 
self-defense still but he's is very clear on  
not hurting on not killing innocent 
people yeah but if you work for the
villains y he doesn't be the best innocent
okay fire oh good cool lighting
fire clean sweep you know who you're working for I 
business I'm just the guy they call when there's a  
problem you're creating a bigger problem man

responsible for your mother's death I believe  
you but we have laws for these things I can't

felt like cuz someone mentioned about meeting with 
pus or something earlier and I was like is she pus  
yeah why not let clay do his thing your mom is 
dead because of these people like Boondock Saints  
I haven't seen it put it on the list okay we think 
we have a sense of Mr Clay's true intentions he  
seems to be following the money looks so much 
slower on that camera nin star United uses  
data mining software to identify these people and 
then Target their assets there's another involved  
are you going to tell me the name of this Company 
Danforth Enterprises with an annual revenue of 10  
billion dollar founded and operated by Jessica 
Danforth who recently stepped down because she  
was sworn in as president of the United States 
who else knows this us three Let's uh keep the  
circle small that's dangerous information to have 
about the president of the United States I see his  
kill count is steadily rising in a beehive there 
is something called a queen Slayer it's a bee that  
will rise up and kill the queen if she produces 
defective Offspring oh my God clay believes that  
Derek Danforth is the defective offspring of a 
queen thereby clay will strike at the heart of  
the problem and become a queen Slayer Adam Clay's 
next victim is Derek Dan for's mother oh my God  
you have a blank check good luck oh this isn't 
insane I would not do that information on a zoom  
call or whatever the hell they I would have th% 
done that in person go away Federal Bureau of  
something or another we're good all right you'll 
need to excuse my partner he's recently concussed  
hasn't slept in 2 days we're on the access list 
good boss n that's been his personality the whole  
movie the whole movie interesting choice they 
picked for that is what it is but the screen time  
they give Jason STM just seems so reserved doesn't 
it yeah like you can go like a extended periods  
without seeing him mom's detail is not going to 
like that well if Mom's detail gets in the way of  
what's coming for us they're dead men and so are 
we tell them they can stay in the kitchen damn

knowing why I Champion mental health support so

really don't like doing that and sometimes that's  
when the weight really starts to pile on a lot of 
restless nights a lot of fatigue a lot of I can't  
sleep even though I'm so tired sometimes just 
a very deep-seated sense of Gloom meditating  
and sometimes journaling are my daily go-tos 
but sometimes they just just don't cut it when  
I'm trying to pinpoint why I'm down and really 
especially after a session like today therapy

a great way to support the channel really is great 
involved ourselves and got two more in development  
right now hopefully get a launch the first one 
within the next week or so uh but yeah man listen  
to us Apple Spotify we just watched The Beekeeper 
Andrew beekeper The Beekeeper he's pretty quiet in  
this one we've watched two movies of Jason sathan 
where he was pretty subdued and quiet but again  
you just always feel his presence and you and uh 
like the way he's emoting his facial expressions  
like it it didn't bother me that he had limited 
dialogue I I I didn't care I loved him so much in  
this movie but I loved how personal it was like 
right away in the first like 10 15 minutes again  
I I'd only experienced that one trailer that you 
showed me after we watched Wrath of man I was like  
this is going to be a schlocky fun little action 
film I was not expecting it to be so heavy-handed  
at least in the first 15 20 minutes and like 
that is a real serious World thing where you  
know people uh especially older people get 
I mean obviously everyone deals with fraud  
and scam uh you know artists and all that but it 
really affects older people my unfortunately my  
grandfather God Rest his soul he dealt with that 
quite a bit um and we had to try and tell him many  
times like no like you got to stop falling for 
this and uh you know that that's a big audience  
of who they go after so uh I like that David a 
Incorporated that into the story and then that  
was obviously the personal thing um also too I 
really loved all the The Beekeeper stuff that  
they were uh you know incorporating with all the 
uh the lines in uh crap that I thought they were  
very interestingly uh and well methodically used 
used you know like just like the the queen beehive  
and the offsp all that stuff it was just so well 
utilized um and just like the organization and  
the backstory and the history there was just 
so many different interesting layers um but  
again the the way everything was balanced out 
from the action to the heavy-hearted and then  
uh little incorporation of the humor as well uh 
I thought very well done um I think like you uh  
my only weak point was some of the the FBI stuff 
uh especially more so on that one actor I'm sure  
he's a great actor I haven't really seen him in 
anything it's just I wasn't particularly fond  
of the way the direction of that character was 
used um personally and uh overall though uh this  
was such a fun time um and such a heavy-hearted 
subject again just with what happened with the  
the one the old nice lady at the beginning you 
know her offing herself um and what happened uh  
just incorporating real life situations and then 
the reveal to that she's the president I was not  
expecting that I just figured just a regular 
politician um just some interesting reveals and  
uh also the hand toand combat oh my freaking God 
I can't even imagine the level of difficulty that  
all that planning took and the way uh you know 
that um uh how long it took to film all of that  
um and Jason STM he is the master that was like 
very impressive to watch uh I got more to say but  
what what did you think Craig uh I thought it was 
a really fun movie I thought it was really fun and  
in a way that I didn't anticipate being fun cuz 
the trailers's pitched something that was going  
to that I thought would just only lean into a 
schlock Fest like you said like a cheese fest  
of of an experience and while the cheesiness is 
there yeah it it it's it's surprising like I think  
in the first 15 20 minutes it was really smart to 
lean into it being serious yeah because if you're  
going to go onto this Mission this Vendetta 
this Revenge Quest against this clandestine  
organization you need to First ground it in 
something that's not just Mission based you  
need to ground in something that is like just 
Primal which is Revenge but get you connected  
to the characters at hand and you need want to and 
the key to any Revenge movie is you have to want  
to feel the character's motivation of getting that 
Revenge it's a real I think revenge stories are a  
very cathartic uh thing for people to experience 
because in real life you know they say don't get  
revenge that's bad most people shouldn't go after 
getting revenge don't take the law your own hands  
yeah yeah exactly but you know it's a fantasy a 
lot of Us wish to live out and and so movies are  
supposed to give us that cathartic experience 
right of those feelings that releasee in a way  
so I think investing you in that uh was smart and 
and I feel like David a is a political commentary  
side of you know uh politics and of course the 
uh 1% systems in place corruption well was there  
it it was all was a big part of the the World 
building to it and there were times throughout  
where I felt like maybe it was taking it I like 
the first half I thought was actually near perfect  
to me I think the first half was near perfect 
in terms of the the the the tonal balance and  
then the last half I thought kind of got a little 
too like seriousness where I thought there was at  
times I thought the self-awareness of what they 
were doing might have been not as self-aware I  
will say you know what I mean like it would just 
get like super serious to the point where cuz this  
movie has a weird um a weird approach where 
you start off with Jason STM as his beekeeper  
and while the movie revolves around him uh in all 
fronts all aspects you'll you'll go these extended  
periods of time where you're cutting around to 
characters who are mainly just plot mechanics  
like you got Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson 
interacting you got uh the the FBI people and  
it feels like they lose sight of what should feel 
more personal for the FBI uh girl aged uh I forget  
I want to get her name cuz I believe she's the 
one from Umbrella Academy yeah I think she is the  
one from umbrella I want to get her name um yeah 
like because and I felt like there was a lack of  
wraparound for her when this started off as this 
should also be something pretty per why does this  
feel more personal for Jason St for her it was 
her mom who died from this you know and and the  
only reason I'm taking that serious is because 
the movie started taking a more serious approach  
but now I'm very selective on using the words but 
and the words however because when they say but  
that means you are negating everything that comes 
before it I'm not negating it's a bit of a but and  
a however however being in conjunction however 
and but I would say that what I showed up for
was grandiose what I showed up for was awesome 
like the action to me and the trailers didn't  
even demonstrate uh what would make the because 
to me whenever I see a Jason stapon trailer the  
action looks the exact same like I feel like 
it's the same choreographer and the same fight  
scenes every time and while he always does a 
great job that I look like the same [ __ ] I've  
seen in like every Jason STM movie and then 
usually when you check into the film itself  
you could see more of the uniqueness and to me 
me because this is a hard R like we saw wrath  
the man where there's no hand to hand right it 
it's it's gun play gun sh and then here uh it's  
it's mainly hand to hand for the guy with this 
like Jason Bourne meets Jackie Chan s level of  
violence where he use use brutality but you're 
using props around you and the presence of Jason  
STM of course like he's he he's that guy who can 
play stoicism but ooze Charisma simultaneously  
it's a gift it really he's got that it factor to 
being a star and and I think he's excellent here  
and the the violence was violent but but creative 
yes and packed a punch and and I really loved uh  
the and there was always a bit of a cathartic 
release and and I like the sequences too when  
he's when he's put in a position like at the uh 
at the estate at the very end when he has to make  
his way to the president you know he's got to 
deal with mercenaries and SWAT team people and  
SWAT team you don't kill mercenaries you can kill 
and and so I like how in that action scene you're  
like paying attention to if anything I think this 
movie really proved David a is a hell of an action  
director because because he has to get you like 
follow the action follow follow this happening uh  
in a sequence like that where normally you just 
only get you don't kill these guys you only you  
can harm them but you don't kill them and here 
I like that that was a unique thing where I feel  
like that can be overlooked it's a mix where 
he's like okay you don't kill that guy but you  
can kill this guy you know and he has to be like 
anticipation anticipatory to that and the final  
fight too like he saved a good brutal I thought 
like the best fights might have been behind us  
early on but he saved that brutal one-on-one 
fight for that very end guy which was amazing  
that fight yeah yeah so sometimes I thought like 
this movie leaned into it cuz you know like you  
got these like wacky colorful villains uh at times 
The Mercenaries or or that other beekeeper lady at  
the gas station where that's where I'm like okay 
I feel like this movie is being self there are  
times like the the the energy of the movie would 
um lose itself lose some of the the like the The  
Dread or drama wasn't strong enough to to Warrant 
some of those scenes for me and then the fun would  
get a little bit lost when you would cut to like 
it was weird because Jeremy Irons podus lady and  
and and and uh Josh Hutson they really gave like 
performances here they did a really good job and  
then the one who plays the FBI agent the FBI agent 
uh it should be her right Emy raver lampin lampin  
okay yeah and like she did a really good job too 
and and I I feel umbrella yeah and I I do think  
they uh like lost sight of her but for terms of 
like an action movie where it was fun and I was  
engaged throughout and had a little more on its 
mind than I was expecting to uh I I thought it  
was really good it pretty much gave me everything 
that I wanted I think the first half is stronger  
but there are some great stuff in the in the last 
half yeah personally yeah yeah know not excuse me  
yeah and I I I hear what you're saying and I 
totally agree with you just like on in terms  
of her character I get it she's an FBI agent you 
got to tiptoe that line on you know your job and I  
get it they did come around to it in the end where 
you know she did let him go which I'm glad she did  
um but yeah it did feel like it was more personal 
to Jason Statham's character uh which again you  
know we we found out like that uh the there was 
that line of dialogue that how she was the only  
one who was ever like you know that motherly 
figure that was kind to him and understandable  
but I I really would have uh you know just if when 
they were leaning more on that serious stuff just  
would have liked that they were showing like that 
she was extremely conflicted with like trying to  
you know do her job or take this more in a more 
personal sense cuz I really feel like that would  
have been a little more grounded in the sense of 
all this but you know it is what it is um but also  
too in in regards to Jason stm's character on top 
of the badass that he was I just loved how you  
know to your point as well in terms of like how 
he was able to sneak into you know the the estate  
and all that he was just so resourceful and you 
know that came into whe whether he was sneaking  
into places whether he had the tactical gear ready 
to go um with the the suit or to go onto the beach  
also too when he uh met the uh charismatic and uh 
best character of the a partner FBI agent uh he's  
like I have kids and he's like yeah three boys 
and a girl and like he just he did his research  
he was extremely uh you know uh just intelligent 
he just knew things and I just I love intelligent  
smart badass characters like that and I just was 
so appreciative of that yeah I think I think this  
was overall like a really this is a solid action 
movie to me it's a solid action movie where um at  
times I could like in the last half particular 
there were certain scenes where I was like is  
this when it was cheesy I felt like intentionally 
self-aware yes and other times I'm like are we not  
self-aware anymore and is this supposed to be like 
really serious CU at times you're supposed to be  
serious so you know and that's what I mean it's 
fine you got to just find a balance though and I  
think sometimes that balance comes a little bit 
off and uh ese but whenever Jason STM is there  
the movie is incredibly engaging and yeah for sure 
I I really thought it it's fine that they didn't  
but I truly thought they were going to go through 
the entire film without him using a gun but the in  
time that they did go that was incredible I mean 
I can't remember the last time I saw an action  
hero in it in this type of film go that long into 
a film like with that many action sequences just  
do hand toand no guns that was impressive yeah but 
I think again that's a testament to David a as a  
director uh is because the buildup to that you 
know like you were really noticing sing it too  
and I was noticing it so they Reserve when he uses 
guns for a moment like they make it a moment when  
he first uses that gun and even the introduction 
like my favorite colorful villain play the last  
guy who had the the the hallway fight with uh 
because even the introduction on that guy like  
he's so much larger than life he's so eccentric 
and crazy but they set him up with the with the  
um pratic leg prosthetic leg and that tells you 
right away like you know this guy can take a hit  
so take a lot of hits he could take a lot of hits 
put a bullet in his face leg he's just going to  
keep coming didn't care so there there is this 
force of nature that just keep I me yeah that  
guy had me saying this dude is a badass too he's 
crazy yeah yeah uh I wonder if the there are any  
fun facts here this is Jason stm's fifth film 
in the last year that's it Adam Clay's birthday  
oh this is a fun fact from the FBI file is July 
2667 which is Jason stam's actual birthday you  
didn't know that was his birthday oh I I didn't 
either okay um this sounds like when Adam clay  
EXC himself from the conversation with agent 
Parker says I have to take care of the hive  
this sounds like he is taking care of his bees 
but instead the first reference to his former  
world to protect Society that's so funny most of 
this was shot in England really a lot of this oh F  
fascinating I would have thought maybe they really 
did shoot in Massachusetts no explanation of the  
old Tech especially the CRT computer monitor seen 
film is ever offered that because the story was  
originally supposed to be said in 2003 remember I 
was saying the computer I was like this is weird  
the computers seem like they're older Tech yeah 
uh before the idea was abandoned however as the  
art Department had already started sourcing uh 
some of the hardware for budgetary reasons it  
decided just to keep in what they had already 
purchased oh that's funny I don't know it kind  
of like worked for me kind of like added to the 
flavor of like they are so underground you know  
uh that was that was that was really interesting 
but no this was a fun fun movie Man uh I I really  
liked it gave what I wanted keep scrolling down 
there's I think there might be some more really  
yeah keep going anything else oh no oh I thought 
that okay I thought there was Nor they get more  
facts when the movie's been while long forgot to 
First St but yeah no overall good stuff um I hope  
this movie is a lesson for the pieces of shits 
out there that do these kinds of things and scam  
people that if you ever do something like this an 
actual beekeeper will come after you um so don't  
even try it um I want to go to an actual beekeeper 
and see what's up be like I know who you really  
are beekeeper like um do you want some honey Craig 
okay I don't know what you're trying to say here I  
hope there are beekeepers out there who have 
have a serious passion for their job who did  
not see the trailer for this and saw oh beekeeper 
finally a movie that does a story about beekeepers  
I can't wait and then see they watch like this 
is all my life like which organization do I need  
to join this is a false representation of me as 
in my profession now people who get scammed are  
going to call me like this is not what I do I've 
been asked to do a lot of things that are not part  
of my what my job entails me to do now all righty 
guys well good job David air awesome and Jason St  
them what did you think of the beekeeper leave 
your thoughts down below I think they can do a  
sequel that goes and wall I would love a sequel 
I really would I really love a sequel it's like  
it's like an eight out of 10 for me yeah I 
would say that too even two if they a sequel  
I'd be down for even if they showed us a prequel 
just what led him to getting to where we started  
the film i' I'd be down for either or I'm just 
so down for this universe The Beekeeper Universe  
yeah I'm like 7.5 to 8 out of 10 somewhere there 
where are you I'd probably go 7.8 out of 10 okay  
yeah I'm like seven point if I'm going to look if 
I'm looking for that solid so yeah 7. 797 damn it  
oh beat me again yeah yeah anyway what do you 
guys think leave your thoughts down below I had  
a really fun time and I would absolutely love
