like\u00a0\nright away in the first like 10 15 minutes again\u00a0\u00a0\nI I'd only experienced that one trailer that you\u00a0\nshowed me after we watched Wrath of man I was like\u00a0\u00a0\nthis is going to be a schlocky fun little action\u00a0\nfilm I was not expecting it to be so heavy-handed\u00a0\u00a0\nat least in the first 15 20 minutes and like\u00a0\nthat is a real serious World thing where you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow people uh especially older people get\u00a0\nI mean obviously everyone deals with fraud\u00a0\u00a0\nand scam uh you know artists and all that but it\u00a0\nreally affects older people my unfortunately my\u00a0\u00a0\ngrandfather God Rest his soul he dealt with that\u00a0\nquite a bit um and we had to try and tell him many\u00a0\u00a0\ntimes like no like you got to stop falling for\u00a0\nthis and uh you know that that's a big audience\u00a0\u00a0\nof who they go after so uh I like that David a\u00a0\nIncorporated that into the story and then that\u00a0\u00a0\nwas obviously the personal thing um also too I\u00a0\nreally loved all the The Beekeeper stuff that\u00a0\u00a0\nthey were uh you know incorporating with all the\u00a0\nuh the lines in uh crap that I thought they were\u00a0\u00a0\nvery interestingly uh and well methodically used\u00a0\nused you know like just like the the queen beehive\u00a0\u00a0\nand the offsp all that stuff it was just so well\u00a0\nutilized um and just like the organization and\u00a0\u00a0\nthe backstory and the history there was just\u00a0\nso many different interesting layers um but\u00a0\u00a0\nagain the the way everything was balanced out\u00a0\nfrom the action to the heavy-hearted and then\u00a0\u00a0\nuh little incorporation of the humor as well uh\u00a0\nI thought very well done um I think like you uh\u00a0\u00a0\nmy only weak point was some of the the FBI stuff\u00a0\nuh especially more so on that one actor I'm sure\u00a0\u00a0\nhe's a great actor I haven't really seen him in\u00a0\nanything it's just I wasn't particularly fond\u00a0\u00a0\nof the way the direction of that character was\u00a0\nused um personally and uh overall though uh this\u00a0\u00a0\nwas such a fun time um and such a heavy-hearted\u00a0\nsubject again just with what happened with the\u00a0\u00a0\nthe one the old nice lady at the beginning you\u00a0\nknow her offing herself um and what happened uh\u00a0\u00a0\njust incorporating real life situations and then\u00a0\nthe reveal to that she's the president I was not\u00a0\u00a0\nexpecting that I just figured just a regular\u00a0\npolitician um just some interesting reveals and\u00a0\u00a0\nuh also the hand toand combat oh my freaking God\u00a0\nI can't even imagine the level of difficulty that\u00a0\u00a0\nall that planning took and the way uh you know\u00a0\nthat um uh how long it took to film all of that\u00a0\u00a0\num and Jason STM he is the master that was like\u00a0\nvery impressive to watch uh I got more to say but\u00a0\u00a0\nwhat what did you think Craig uh I thought it was\u00a0\na really fun movie I thought it was really fun and\u00a0\u00a0\nin a way that I didn't anticipate being fun cuz\u00a0\nthe trailers's pitched something

yeah it it it's it's surprising like I think\u00a0\u00a0\nin the first 15 20 minutes it was really smart to\u00a0\nlean into it being serious yeah because if you're\u00a0\u00a0\ngoing to go onto this

that\u00a0\nRevenge it's a real I think revenge stories are a\u00a0\u00a0\nvery cathartic uh thing for people to experience\u00a0\nbecause in real life you know they say don't get\u00a0\u00a0\nrevenge that's bad most people shouldn't go after\u00a0\ngetting revenge don't take the law your own hands\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah yeah exactly but you know it's a fantasy a\u00a0\nlot of Us wish to live out and and so movies are\u00a0\u00a0\nsupposed to give us that cathartic experience\u00a0\nright of those feelings that releasee in a way\u00a0\u00a0\nso I think investing you in that uh was smart and\u00a0\nand I feel like David a is a political commentary\u00a0\u00a0\nside of you know uh politics and of course the\u00a0\nuh 1% systems in place corruption well was there\u00a0\u00a0\nit it was all was a big part of the the World\u00a0\nbuilding to it and there were times throughout\u00a0\u00a0\nwhere I felt like maybe it was taking it I like\u00a0\nthe first half I thought was actually near perfect\u00a0\u00a0\nto me I think the first half was near perfect\u00a0\nin terms of the the the the tonal balance and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen the last half I thought kind of got a little\u00a0\ntoo like seriousness where I thought there was at\u00a0\u00a0\ntimes I thought the self-awareness of what they\u00a0\nwere doing might have been not as self-aware I\u00a0\u00a0\nwill say you know what I mean like it would just\u00a0\nget like super serious to the point where cuz this\u00a0\u00a0\nmovie has a weird um a weird approach where\u00a0\nyou start off with Jason STM as his beekeeper\u00a0\u00a0\nand while the movie revolves around him uh in all\u00a0\nfronts all aspects you'll you'll go these extended\u00a0\u00a0\nperiods of time where you're cutting around to\u00a0\ncharacters who are mainly just plot mechanics\u00a0\u00a0\nlike you got Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson\u00a0\ninteracting you got uh the the FBI people and\u00a0\u00a0\nit feels like they lose sight of what should feel\u00a0\nmore personal for the FBI uh girl aged uh I forget\u00a0\u00a0\nI want to get her name cuz I believe she's the\u00a0\none from Umbrella Academy yeah I think she is the\u00a0\u00a0\none from umbrella I want to get her name um yeah\u00a0\nlike because and I felt like there was a lack of\u00a0\u00a0\nwraparound for her when this started off as this\u00a0\nshould also be something pretty per why does this\u00a0\u00a0\nfeel more personal for Jason St for her it was\u00a0\nher mom who died from this you know and and the\u00a0\u00a0\nonly reason I'm taking that serious is because\u00a0\nthe movie started taking a more serious approach\u00a0\u00a0\nbut now I'm very selective on using the words but\u00a0\nand the words however because when they say but\u00a0\u00a0\nthat means you are negating everything that comes\u00a0\nbefore it I'm not negating it's a bit of a but and\u00a0\u00a0\na however however being in conjunction however\u00a0\nand but I would say that what I showed up for\nwas grandiose what I showed up for was awesome\u00a0\nlike the action to me and the trailers didn't\u00a0\u00a0\neven demonstrate uh what would make the

here\u00a0\u00a0\nand the the violence was violent but but creative\u00a0\nyes and packed a punch and and I really loved uh\u00a0\u00a0\nthe and there was always a bit of a cathartic\u00a0\nrelease and and I like the sequences too when\u00a0\u00a0\nhe's when he's put in a position like at the uh\u00a0\nat the estate at the very end when he has to make\u00a0\u00a0\nhis way to the president you know he's got to\u00a0\ndeal with mercenaries and SWAT team people and\u00a0\u00a0\nSWAT team you don't kill mercenaries you can kill\u00a0\nand and so I like how in that action scene you're\u00a0\u00a0\nlike paying attention to if anything I think this\u00a0\nmovie really proved David a is a hell of an action\u00a0\u00a0\ndirector because because he has to get you like\u00a0\nfollow the action follow follow this happening uh\u00a0\u00a0\nin a sequence like that where normally you just\u00a0\nonly get you don't kill these guys you only you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan harm them but you don't kill them and here\u00a0\nI like that that was a unique thing where I feel\u00a0\u00a0\nlike that can be overlooked it's a mix where\u00a0\nhe's like okay you don't kill that guy but you\u00a0\u00a0\ncan kill this guy you know and he has to be like\u00a0\nanticipation anticipatory to that and the final\u00a0\u00a0\nfight too like he saved a good brutal I thought\u00a0\nlike the best fights might have been behind us\u00a0\u00a0\nearly on but he saved that brutal one-on-one\u00a0\nfight for that very end guy which was amazing\u00a0\u00a0\nthat fight yeah yeah so sometimes I thought like\u00a0\nthis movie leaned into it cuz you know like you\u00a0\u00a0\ngot these like wacky colorful villains uh at times\u00a0\nThe Mercenaries or or that other beekeeper lady at\u00a0\u00a0\nthe gas station where that's where I'm like okay\u00a0\nI feel like this movie is being self there are\u00a0\u00a0\ntimes like the the the energy of the movie would\u00a0\num lose itself lose some of the the like the The\u00a0\u00a0\nDread or drama wasn't strong enough to to Warrant\u00a0\nsome of those scenes for me and then the fun would\u00a0\u00a0\nget a little bit lost when you would cut to like\u00a0\nit was weird because Jeremy Irons podus lady and\u00a0\u00a0\nand and and uh Josh Hutson they really gave like\u00a0\nperformances here they did a really good job and\u00a0\u00a0\nthen the one who plays the FBI agent the FBI agent\u00a0\nuh it should be her right Emy raver lampin lampin\u00a0\u00a0\nokay yeah and like she did a really good job too\u00a0\nand and I I feel umbrella yeah and I I do think\u00a0\u00a0\nthey uh like lost sight of her but for terms of\u00a0\nlike an action movie where it was fun and I was\u00a0\u00a0\nengaged throughout and had a little more on its\u00a0\nmind than I was expecting to uh I I thought it\u00a0\u00a0\nwas really good it pretty much gave me everything\u00a0\nthat I wanted I think the first half is stronger\u00a0\u00a0\nbut there are some great stuff in the in the last\u00a0\nhalf yeah personally yeah yeah know not excuse me\u00a0\u00a0\nyeah and I I I hear what you're saying and I\u00a0\ntotally agree with you just like on in terms\u00a0\u00a0\nof her character I get it she's an FBI agent you\u00a0\ngot to tiptoe that line on you know your job and I\u00a0\u00a0\nget it they did come around to it in the end where\u00a0\nyou know she did let him go which I'm glad she did\u00a0\u00a0\num but yeah it did feel like it was more personal\u00a0\nto Jason Statham's character uh which again you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow we we found out like that uh the there was\u00a0\nthat line of dialogue that how she was the only\u00a0\u00a0\none who was ever like you know that

only\u00a0\u00a0\none who was ever like you know that motherly\u00a0\nfigure that was kind to him and understandable\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I I really would have uh you know just if when\u00a0\nthey were leaning more on that serious stuff just\u00a0\u00a0\nwould have liked that they were showing like that\u00a0\nshe was extremely conflicted with like trying to\u00a0\u00a0\nyou know do her job or take this more in a more\u00a0\npersonal sense cuz I really feel like that would\u00a0\u00a0\nhave been a little more grounded in the sense of\u00a0\nall this but you know it is what it is um but also\u00a0\u00a0\ntoo in in regards to Jason stm's character on top\u00a0\nof the badass that he was I just loved how you\u00a0\u00a0\nknow to your point as well in terms of like how\u00a0\nhe was able to sneak into you know the the estate\u00a0\u00a0\nand all that he was just so resourceful and you\u00a0\nknow that came into whe whether he was sneaking\u00a0\u00a0\ninto places whether he had the tactical gear ready\u00a0\nto go um with the the suit or to go onto the beach\u00a0\u00a0\nalso too when he uh met the uh charismatic and uh\u00a0\nbest character of the a partner FBI agent uh he's\u00a0\u00a0\nlike I have kids and he's like yeah three boys\u00a0\nand a girl and like he just he did his research\u00a0\u00a0\nhe was extremely uh you know uh just intelligent\u00a0\nhe just knew things and I just I love intelligent\u00a0\u00a0\nsmart badass characters like that and I just was\u00a0\nso appreciative of that yeah I think I think this\u00a0\u00a0\nwas overall like a really this is a solid action\u00a0\nmovie to me it's a solid action movie where um at\u00a0\u00a0\ntimes I could like in the last half particular\u00a0\nthere were certain scenes where I was like is\u00a0\u00a0\nthis when it was cheesy I felt like intentionally\u00a0\nself-aware yes and other times I'm like are we not\u00a0\u00a0\nself-aware anymore and is this supposed to be like\u00a0\nreally serious CU at times you're supposed to be\u00a0\u00a0\nserious so you know and that's what I mean it's\u00a0\nfine you got to just find a balance though and I\u00a0\u00a0\nthink sometimes that balance comes a little bit\u00a0\noff and uh ese but whenever Jason STM is there\u00a0\u00a0\nthe movie is incredibly engaging and yeah for sure\u00a0\nI I really thought it it's fine that they didn't\u00a0\u00a0\nbut I truly thought they were going to go through\u00a0\nthe entire film without him using a gun but the in\u00a0\u00a0\ntime that they did go that was incredible I mean\u00a0\nI can't remember the last time I saw an action\u00a0\u00a0\nhero in it in this type of film go that long into\u00a0\na film like with that many action sequences just\u00a0\u00a0\ndo hand toand no guns that was impressive yeah but\u00a0\nI think again that's a testament to David a as a\u00a0\u00a0\ndirector uh is because the buildup to that you\u00a0\nknow like you were really noticing sing it too\u00a0\u00a0\nand I was noticing it so they Reserve when he uses\u00a0\nguns for a moment like they make it a moment when\u00a0\u00a0\nhe first uses that gun and even the introduction\u00a0\nlike my favorite colorful villain play the last\u00a0\u00a0\nguy who had the the the hallway fight with uh\u00a0\nbecause even the introduction on that guy like\u00a0\u00a0\nhe's so much larger than life he's so eccentric\u00a0\nand crazy but they set him up with the with the\u00a0\u00a0\num pratic leg prosthetic leg and that tells you\u00a0\nright away like you know this guy can take a hit\u00a0\u00a0\nso take a lot of hits he could take a lot of hits\u00a0\nput a bullet in his face leg he's just going to\u00a0\u00a0\nkeep coming didn't care so there there is this\u00a0\nforce of nature that just keep I me yeah that\u00a0\u00a0\nguy had me saying this dude is a badass too he's\u00a0\ncrazy yeah yeah uh I wonder if the there are any\u00a0\u00a0\nfun facts here this is Jason stm's fifth film\u00a0\nin the last year that's it Adam Clay's birthday\u00a0\u00a0\noh this is a fun fact from the FBI file is July\u00a0\n2667 which is Jason stam's",

the idea was abandoned however as the\u00a0\u00a0\nart Department had already started sourcing uh\u00a0\nsome of the hardware for budgetary reasons it\u00a0\u00a0\ndecided just to keep in what they
